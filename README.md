# Cartoonifier-The-Image
Do you miss your childhood? Yes, everyone does.! So today letâ€™s head towards giving our pictures some cartoonist effects. This article is all about building a photo cartoonifyer using Python and OpenCV

Modules:

#CV2: Imported to use OpenCV for image processing.

#easygui: Imported to open a file box. It allows us to select any file from our system.

#Numpy: Images are stored and processed as numbers. These are taken as arrays. We use NumPy to deal with arrays.

#Imageio: Used to read the file which is chosen by file box using a path.

#Matplotlib: This library is used for visualization and plotting. Thus, it is imported to form the plot of images.

#OS: For OS interaction. Here, to read the path and save images to that path.
